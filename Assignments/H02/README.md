## Definitions

Key Words


#### Abstraction
>Displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.

#### Attributes / Properties
> A specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a
> given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly be considered metadata. An attribute  is frequently and
> generally a property of a property. However, in actual usage, the term attribute can and is often treated as equivalent to a
> property depending on the technology being discussed. An attribute of an object usually consists of a name and a value; of an
> element, a type or class name; of a file, a name and extension.

#### Class
> An extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior.

#### Class Variable
> Any variable declared with the static modifier of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class
> exist.

#### Composition
> A way to combine objects or data types into more complex ones. Compositions relate to, but are not the same as, data structures,
> and common ones are the tagged union, set, sequence, and various graph structures, as well as the object used in object-oriented
> programming.

#### Encapsulation
> The bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit. Many programming languages use 
> encapsulation frequently in the form of classes.

#### Friends
> A function that is given the same access as methods to private and protected data. A friend function is declared by the class
> that is granting access, so friend functions are part of the class interface, like methods.

#### Inheritance
> The mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance),
> retaining similar implementation

#### Instance Variable
> Is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate
> copy, or instance.

#### Member Variable
> A variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods (member functions).

#### Method
> A programmed procedure that is defined as part of a class and included in any object of that class. A class (and thus an object)
> can have more than one method. A method in an object can only have access to the data known to       > that  object, which ensures data integrity among the set of objects in an application. A method can be re-used in multiple objects.

#### Multiple Inheritance
> A feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit characteristics and 
> features from more than one parent object or parent class.

#### Object
> An object is an abstract data type with the addition of polymorphism and inheritance. Rather than structure programs as code and
> data, an object-oriented system integrates the two using the concept of an "object". An object has state > (data) and behavior 
> (code). Objects can correspond to things found in the real world

#### Overloading
> In some programming languages, function overloading or method overloading is the ability to create multiple functions of the 
> same name with different implementations.

#### Polymorphism
> Is the ability of a programming language to present the same interface for several different underlying data types. Polymorphism
> is the ability of different objects to respond in a unique way to the same message.

#### Public/Private/Protected
> Public means everyone is allowed to access, private means that only members of the same class are allowed to access, and 
> protected means that members of subclasses are also allowed.

#### Virtual
> A virtual class is a nested inner class whose functions and member variables can be overridden and redefined by subclasses of 
> an outer class.
